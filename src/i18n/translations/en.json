I worked as an interpreter, guide, monitor, and I got to know several people and places. But... that &quot;click&quot; was missing, you know? As I have always been into technology, I decided to jump in this area as soon as I had the opportunity. Right decision! I like to creating, innovating, facing challenges, I have great hability to work in group and I believe that in this new professional field I can go far away.
